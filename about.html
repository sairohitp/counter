            ew, why is the design so bad? the buttons too big?
            <br>
            idk, sorry but everyone's not an *artist*. but hey, constructive criticism is welcomed :x
            <br><br>
            yeah right like people are gonna make their lives totally dependant on this program.
            <br><br>
            however, lightspeed to the point, this is an application to keep track of whatever it is that you need
            keeping track of using three functional buttons that can either increment, decrement, or reset the value.
            <br><br>
            Use cases are infinte, solution and working is simple.
            <br>This emphasizes three points:
            <br>
            <br>&bullet; I'm a genius
            <br>&bullet; I a solve world class problem
            <br>&bullet; Artisitic (obv)
