# Tally Counter
A website with a widget that can be used to keep track of a value.

This is an application to keep track of whatever it is that you need keeping track of using three functional buttons that can either increment, decrement, or reset the value.

Uses basic concepts of JavaScript

Created for my projects' portfolio, yet, anyone is welcomed & free to clone it.

Thanks.
